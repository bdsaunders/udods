udods is the University of Delaware version of the C++ files associated 
with Pat Morin's Open Data structures online text (itself a Github project).  

The initial files are those of Morin's ods/cpp/ directory.

The udods project is for the course CISC 220 Data Structures.  We will be modifying files for 
(a) bug fixes, 
(b) creation of variant functionality, and 
(c) introduction of new implementations of various data structures.

Specific assignments in the course will use specific versions of udods.
